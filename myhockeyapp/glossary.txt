Fenwick
Fenwick is shots plus all shots attempts that missed the net (i.e. hit the post/crossbar, shot wide, etc.)
Corsi
Corsi is Fenwick plus all shots attempts that were blocked by the defending team.
TM Statistics
TM statistics are like a composite WOWY (With or Without You) statistic. Let's take Dion Phaneuf's TMCF60 (TeamMate Corsi For per 60 minutes of ice time) as an example. In this case Phaneuf's TMCF60 is a weighted average of each players CF60 when Phaneuf isn't on the ice with them weighted by the ice time they have played with Phaneuf (for players with fewer than 100 minutes apart from Phaneuf their overall CF60 is used instead to keep sample sizes from getting too small).
One could consider TM statistics an expected value for the player if the player had no (positive or negative) influence on his team mates results when he plays with them.

Opp Statistics
Opp statistics are almost identical to TM statistics but considers every opponent as opposed to every teammate. This is best considered as a quality of competition statistic.
RelTM statistics
RelTM statistics are nothing more than the players statistic minus the equivalent TM statistic. So, CF20RelTM = CF20 - TMCF20.
% of Team Statistics
These represent the players on-ice statistics as a percentage of the teams overall statistics in games that the player has played in. If a player had a %ofTeam TOI of 32.0 it would mean that the player played in 32.0% of the teams ice time in games that he played in. A %ofTeam GF of 35.0 would mean the player was on the ice for 35% of all the goals scored by the team in games that the player played in.
IPP, IAP, IGP, IPPP
IPP is individual points percentage and is the # of points a player has divided by the number of goals scored while the player was on the ice. IGP is individual goals percentage and IAP is individual assists percentage. These are calculated the same way but use goals and assists instead of points. IPPP is individual primary points percentage only considers goals and first assists (ignores secondary assists) but is otherwise calculated the same as IPP.
IPP and IPP tell us which players are most integral (or most involved) to the teams offensive production when the player is on the ice and IGP and IAP is an indication of whether the player is more of a goal scorer or play maker.

Zone Start Adjusted
Zone Start Adjusted statistics remove the 10 seconds immediately after a zone face off. It has been shown that the majority of the benefit or penalty of a zone start occurs during the first 10 seconds.
