7. Create a local .gitignore
If you create a file in your repository named .gitignore, Git uses it to determine which files and 
directories to ignore, before you make a commit.
A .gitignore file should be committed into your repository, in order to share the ignore rules with any other users 
that clone the repository

In Terminal, navigate to the location of your Git repository
Enter touch .gitignore to create a .gitignore file
